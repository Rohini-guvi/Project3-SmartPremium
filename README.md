# Project3-SmartPremium
SmartPremium- Predicting Insurance Costs with Machine Learning.

**Objective:**

- The objective is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts insurance premiums based on customer characteristics and policy details.
- The models used in this project are DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, LinearRegressor and XGBRegressor.
- Implementing a Streamlit app with Decision Tree Regressor best model for premium amount calculation.

**Business Use Cases:**
- Insurance Companies optimizes premium pricing based on risk factors.
- Financial Institutions assess risk for loan approvals tied to insurance policies.
- Customer Service Optimization provides real-time insurance quotes based on data-driven predictions.
